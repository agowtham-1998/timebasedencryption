# 🔐 Time-Based Puzzle Encryption (Carousel Edition)

This project showcases a **clock + date–driven encryption puzzle system** in an interactive HTML format.

🧩 Each password is:
- Calculated based on the **current day & hour**
- Encoded using simple math: `hour × 24`, `× 60`, `× 3600`
- Transformed into a hidden string like `0x04-68*0A44_142|1A`
- Designed to be **solvable only if the user knows the current time**

📆 12 unique day codes  
🕒 Real-world time logic  
💡 Perfect for LinkedIn security challenges, brainteasers, and carousel storytelling.
